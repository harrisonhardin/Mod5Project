# Goals

Our goal is to create a classification model using a [collection of wine 
reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) on Kaggle, originally 
from Wine Enthusiast.

Lindsey will be looking to create an unsupervised classification model, 
looking to see if the unsupervised model will categorize the wines in a way
that resembles how a human would classify wine. 

Harrison will be looking to see if he can predict the score of the wine based 
on the length of the review. He will also be briding into wine composition


### Possible Level Up:

Doing some natural language processing on the wine descriptions, which I know
they tell us not to do in the project description but we totally could.
