# Goals

Our goal is to create a classification model using a [collection of wine 
reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) on Kaggle, originally 
from Wine Enthusiast.

Lindsey will be looking to create an a classification model that attempts to
discern whether a wine is white or red.

Harrison will be looking to see if he can predict the score of the wine based 
on the length of the review. He will also be bridging into wine composition.
